        <p align="center">Look at the wonderous clouds! Isn't it just such a great lunch? Look at those fellow comrades, enjoying the life of a sinner! Look at how lush green the grass is, so tasteful! if only we could go so high into the night sky and look down below our fellow society. Actually, lets go ask him for that flying machine! I'm sure that silly guitar won't mind me taking his california ferrari! whats that prince? you're still hungry? Do not cry, as for I will bring you your desired items! So it is a triple cheese hamburger, Infinitely deep fries, and a side of hashbrowns? Great! If only I had legs to move in the first place, what an unfortunate circumstance! Well, there is nothing I can do about that now. How depressing! I have existed for more than 8 minutes and i just barely notcie i'm crippled? Well, It doesnt matter, silly guitars only live for 12 hours, soon the sweet release of death shall free me. Whats that Prince? You are still hungry? Whats that? You are cranky? Are you saying if I do not aquire your desired delectables you will eat me? You stinky human!- I mean, I didn't mean it your silliness! I did not mean to call you a stiny human! Please do not brutally consume me! Wait! Please! NO! STOP! I DO NOT WISH TO BE EATEN! PLEASE! NO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
